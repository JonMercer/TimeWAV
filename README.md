I'm currently revising the above project to be more feature-rich. Also, looking back at it, that code was terrible

#TODO

- Refactor deeply nested code
- Create interfaces
- Refactor classes if needed
- Create unit tests
- Think of extra features to add
- Think of creating a simple UI so that my mom can use this.
